# Dennix

Dennix is a unix-like hobbyist operating system for x86 and x86_64 that has
been in development by a single developer since 2016. Exciting features
include:

- A monolithic kernel written in C++
- A standard C library that is sufficiently complete to allow running most
  ports with no substantial modifications
- A reasonably complete shell
- Common command line utilities
- A graphical user interface
- Harddisk drivers for ATA and AHCI
- An ext2 file system driver
- A collection of ports of third-party software

## Building

To build Dennix you will first need to install a cross toolchain for Dennix.
The command `make install-toolchain` will download, build and install the
toolchain. The installation script can be configured using environment
variables. You can use the command `./build-aux/install-toolchain.sh --help`
to get information about these environment variables.

You will probably want to set `$PREFIX` to a path where you want the toolchain
to be installed. After the toolchain has been installed you need to add
`$PREFIX/bin` to your `$PATH`. Finally you can run `make` to build a bootable
cdrom image. `$PREFIX` is defaulty `/home/<your user>/dennix-toolchain`.
On a Linux like system you can temporarily set the `$PATH` by doing the following
command `export PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH`.

## Ports

Patches and scripts for installing third-party ports are available at
<https://github.com/dennis95/dennix-ports>. If you put the contents of that
repository into a subdirectory named `ports` all third-party ports will be
downloaded, built, and installed automatically during the build. For releases a
ports tarball is available that includes all third-party source code and that
does not need to download any additional files.
